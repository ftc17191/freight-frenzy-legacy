# FTC Layer

Welcome!
FTC Layer is a abstraction layer over the FTC SDK designed to make programming easier
and less time consuming. FTC Layer optimizes The original FTC SDK by making it easier to use drivetrains, gamepads, make autonomouses, and more!

FTC Layer is not designed for beginner programmers, nor is it compatible with OnBotJava, or blocks. If you are looking for a more beginner friendly experience then head on over to a great project we love, FTC Lib.
